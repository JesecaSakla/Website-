            8/25/23 - This is my first journal entry. Today in class we did a challege using marbles and pipes and the challenge was to get the marble all the way to the bucket using only the pipes to getthe marble through. During this challenge, I learned that it takes many attempts to make soomething be sucessful. I also learned that workig as a team is very important in making a project.

            9/11/23 - When staring this project, my group and I decied in a design for our Rube Goldburg Machine. After we decided on a design, we worked together to CAD our machine. Then, we started to draw out all the parts by measuring all the different peices of the machine on carboard and statered to cut them out.
