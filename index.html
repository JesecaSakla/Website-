            8/25/23 - This is my first journal entry. Today in class we did a challege using marbles and pipes and the challenge was to get the marble all the way to the bucket using only the pipes to getthe marble through. During this challenge, I learned that it takes many attempts to make soomething be sucessful. I also learned that workig as a team is very important in making a project.

            9/11/23 - When staring this project, my group and I decied in a design for our Rube Goldburg Machine. After we decided on a design, we worked together to CAD our machine. Then, we started to draw out all the parts by measuring all the different peices of the machine on carboard and started to cut them out.

    </p> 9/15/23- Today we fininished buliding our Rube Goldburg Machine and we tested it out today. During the proccess of building, our design was very effecient because on how organized we were during the process. For example, we measured and drew out al the different parts of our machine before we cut or put anything together.When we tried our machine after it was all done, it sucessuflly poped the balloon on our first try as we hoped it would and took a video and a picture of the final result!

    </p> 9/29/23- Today is our last day learning about computer engineering. Computer engineering is a combination of electrical engineering and computer science. For our computer engineering project, we completely took apart a computer while learning about the different parts that go into a computer as well as how it functions.During this process, I learned that a computerÂ´s functions are very complicated and many things go into a computer such as a motherboard, storage, audio, GPU, CPU, ect...

    </p>10/6/23- Today in class, we learned about bioengineering and made a prothetic hand that can hold a water botle. At first, our design was to make a hand with no fingers, however, it did not take long for us to realize that it was not working at all whatsoever. Then we desingned another hand which can be more effecient so that we could lift the water bottle. We had some help from Cathrine who grnerously helped complete our second design. After we were done with our hand, we tried it out and it sucessuflly worked.
