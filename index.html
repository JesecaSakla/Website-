            8/25/23 - This is my first journal entry. Today in class we did a challege using marbles and pipes and the challenge was to get the marble all the way to the bucket using only the pipes to getthe marble through. During this challenge, I learned that it takes many attempts to make soomething be sucessful. I also learned that workig as a team is very important in making a project.

            9/11/23 - When staring this project, my group and I decied in a design for our Rube Goldburg Machine. After we decided on a design, we worked together to CAD our machine. Then, we started to draw out all the parts by measuring all the different peices of the machine on carboard and started to cut them out.

    <p> 9/15/23- Today we fininished buliding our Rube Goldburg Machine and we tested it out today. During the proccess of building, our design was very effecient because on how organized we were during the process. For example, we measured and drew out al the different parts of our machine before we cut or put anything together.When we tried our machine after it was all done, it sucessuflly poped the balloon on our first try as we hoped it would and took a video and a picture of the final result!

    <p> 9/29/23- Today is our last day learning about computer engineering. Computer engineering is a combination of electrical engineering and computer science. For our computer engineering project, we completely took apart a computer while learning about the different parts that go into a computer as well as how it functions.During this process, I learned that a computerÂ´s functions are very complicated and many things go into a computer such as a motherboard, storage, audio, GPU, CPU, ect...

    <p>10/6/23- Today in class, we learned about bioengineering and made a prothetic hand that can hold a water botle. At first, our design was to make a hand with no fingers, however, it did not take long for us to realize that it was not working at all whatsoever. Then we desingned another hand which can be more effecient so that we could lift the water bottle. We had some help from Cathrine who grnerously helped complete our second design. After we were done with our hand, we tried it out and it sucessuflly worked.

    <p> 10/20/23- Today in class, we tested out our rocket that we made for our areospace engineering unit. Before we built this rocket, we used Tinker CAD to design out rocket. When we built this rocket, we used a 2 liter bottle, cardboard, paper, and hot glue. We desingned our rocket to have  parralelogram shaped wings and a cone at the top. When we tested our rocket, it went pertty high.

     <p> 10/26/23- Today in class, we desingned a water filter for our enviornmental engineering prject. For this project, we could use bottles, cotton, sand, big and small rocks. My partner and I has an idea to place the cotton at the botton of the bottle, then put the sand, small rocks, and finaly big rocks. We did this so that the big particals of filthy water would get fitered first using the pebbles and slowing making the water clear. We put our water in the filter a few times and it made more and more  progress. </p>

    <p> 11/3/23- Today in class, we learned many things about electrical engineering. For our assingment, we had to create a few circuts on Tinker CAD. On Tinker CAD, we had to make three light bulbs light up using resistors, a bread and a battery. We connected the positive parts of the battery to the positive parts of the bread board and the negative part of the battery to teh negative part of the bread board.  </p>
