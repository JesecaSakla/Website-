            8/25/23 - This is my first journal entry. Today in class we did a challege using marbles and pipes and the challenge was to get the marble all the way to the bucket using only the pipes to getthe marble through. During this challenge, I learned that it takes many attempts to make soomething be sucessful. I also learned that workig as a team is very important in making a project.
